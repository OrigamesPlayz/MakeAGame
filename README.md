Oh no! All the game blocks have been misplaced!

Can you find a way to use the least amount of blocks to reset the game?

Controls:

WASD - To move

E - To pick up objects

R - Reset player

B - Build mode

E - Rotate building object clockwise

Q - Rotate building object anticlockwise

Note: The blocks below are your inventory for building, click them to use the objects (there is no image for the 2x1x1 and jump pad blocks but it is that order respectively) if you click on a different item in your inventory when you have not finished using the object you are currently using it will place it down, THIS IS A BUG I HAVE NOT FIXED YET.

This game was created for week 12 of Hackclub Siege and is attempted to follow the theme of framework using the idea of building your own path towards the goal.

Have fun reviewers and others! :)
