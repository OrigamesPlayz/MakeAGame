Oh no! All the game blocks have been misplaced!

Can you find a way to use the least amount of blocks to reset the game?

Controls:

WASD - To move

E - To pick up objects

R - Reset player

B - Build mode

E - Rotate building object clockwise

Q - Rotate building object anticlockwise

This game was created for week 12 of Hackclub Siege and is attempted to follow the theme of framework using the idea of building your own path towards the goal.

Have fun reviewers and others! :)
